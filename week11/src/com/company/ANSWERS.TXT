Exercise 11.1
1. Check out 'TestMSQueue.java'.

2. Check out 'TestMSQueue.java'.

3. As presented in the lecture, removing the checks E7 and D5 does not
   seem to affect the functionality, so the tests run without errors.
   However, commenting out the statement 'if (head.compareAndSet(first, next))'
   (D13) affects the tests, since the dequeue() tries to fetch wrong values
   (in our case, it tries to fetch 10 instead of 2, because 10 was not properly
   dequeued in the previous operation).
